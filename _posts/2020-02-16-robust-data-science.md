Large scale analysis of computational notebooks holds the promise of better understanding the data science process, and providing insights to the builders of scientific toolkits. However, such notebooks have remained largely unanalyzed at scale, as labels are absent and require expert domain knowledge to generate. We present a new classification task for labeling computational notebook cells as stages in the data analysis process (i.e., data import, wrangling, exploration, modeling, and evaluation). For this task, we propose a novel weakly supervised transformer architecture for computing joint represen- tations of data science code from both abstract syntax trees and natural language annotations. We show that our model, leveraging only easily-available weak supervision, achieves a 35% increase in accuracy over expert-supplied heuristics.
